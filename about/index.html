          I am currently a senior in college studying Statistics, French, Mathematics, and Psychology at Grand Valley State University. I then plan to go on and obtain a Master's in Data Science. This might seem like an odd combination. To that I say that I am interested in a great many diverse studies help me satiate my desire to learn more. I suck up information like a black hole because information is cool and gives me the ability to spit out random facts at any given moment.

          I have taken part in multiple research projects, notably the Student Summer Scholars program where I wrote my own analysis of the French <i>Encyclopédie</i> titled <q>Plagiarism of the Plates? The Validity of Accusations Against Diderot's <i>Encyclopédie</i> (1751-1772)</q> and the Honors Senior Project where I coded a recommendation algorithm for Spotify users, designed to be used in anyone's future research projects (<q>The Quest for New Music: A Recommendation Algorithm for Spotify Users</q>). I just completed a book titled <i>Better Git Started: An Introduction to the Command Line, GitHub, and Git</i>, perfect for those who want to begin using Git and GitHub but who are unsure how to start.

          Outside of school, I enjoy reading (I'm currently reading an H.P. Lovecraft collection), walking my dog, and everything music (listening, recording, writing, publishing, playing instruments, etc.). I can play piano and violin well but I am mediocre at ukulele, mandolin, kalimba, and harmonica. I also collect fun-printed socks, baseball cards, and CDs. Oh, and I like Sims.
