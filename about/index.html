        I am currently a senior in college studying Statistics, French, Mathematics, and Psychology at Grand Valley State University. I then plan to go on and obtain a Master's in Data Science. This might seem like an odd combination. To that I say that I am simply interested in a great many things and diverse studies help me satiate my desire to learn more.

        I have taken part in multiple research projects, notably the Student Summer Scholars program where I wrote my own analysis of the French <i>Encyclopédie</i> titled <q>Plagiarism of the Plates? The Validity of Accusations Against Diderot's Encyclopédie (1751-1772)</q> and the Honors Senior Project where I coded a recommendation algorithm for Spotify users, designed to be used in anyone's future research projects (<q>The Quest for New Music: A Recommendation Algorithm for Spotify Users</q>). I just completed a book titled <i>Better Git Started: An Introduction to the Command Line, GitHub, and Git</i>, perfect for those who want to begin using Git and GitHub but who are unsure how to start.

        Outside of school, I enjoy reading (I'm currently reading an H.P. Lovecraft collection), walking my dog, and everything music (listening, recording, writing, publishing, playing instruments, etc.). I can play piano and violin well but I am mediocre at ukulele, mandolin, kalimba, and harmonica. I also collect fun-printed socks. I haven't counted but I think I have over 200 different pairs.
