        <h1>About the Track</h1>
        <p>
          I bought a ukulele from Amazon Prime day and wanted to put it into a song somehow. However, when it came to original music, my vibe at the time was definitely piano and I was finding it difficult to add in ukulele. So I took one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite bands and did a cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't have fancy technology or a real music studio. Nor had I purchased any software (GarageBand is fantastic but now that I have Logic I can never go back). I only had one microphone and a record button. As a result, this song was recorded all in one take, vocals and ukulele at the same time in the same microphone. (This isn't usually how it's done, lol.) It only took three tries for me to get one I was <q>satisfied</q> with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say <q>satisfied</q> in quotes because it was WAY out of my comfort zone to be singing, let alone publishing it on the internet. I knew that I wasn't going to sound that great and that the final product wouldn't be polished, but I still wanted to try. I consider this track a huge step in my learning process and growth. It gave me motivation to continue writing songs for vocals and to learn more about how to record and mix tracks with vocals.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, yeah. I know the track isn't perfect. I know that it's really simple and has some flaws. But I don't care because I love Imagine Dragons, I love creating music, and I love where I have gone because of this cover.

        <div class="chorus">
          <p>
            I'm bleeding out<br>
            So if the last thing that I do<br>
            Is bring you down<br>
            I'll bleed out for you
          </p>
          <p>
            So I bare my skin<br>
            And I count my sins<br>
            And I close my eyes<br>
            And I take it in<br>
            I'm bleeding out<br>
            I'm bleeding out for you, for you
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          When the day has come<br>
          That I've lost my way around<br>
          And the seasons stop<br>
          And hide beneath the ground<br>
          When the sky turns gray<br>
          And everything is screaming<br>
          I will reach inside<br>
          Just to find my heart is beating
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, you tell me to hold on<br>
          Oh, you tell me to hold on<br>
          But innocence is gone<br>
          And what was right is wrong
        </p>
        <div class="chorus">
          <p>
            'Cause I'm bleeding out<br>
            So if the last thing that I do<br>

            I'll bleed out for you

          When the hour is nigh<br>
          And hopelessness is sinking in<br>
          And the wolves all cry<br>
          To fill the night with hollering<br>
          When your eyes are red<br>
          And emptiness is all you know<br>
          With the darkness fed<br>
          I will be your scarecrow
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, you tell me to hold on<br>
          Oh, you tell me to hold on<br>
          But innocence is gone<br>
          And what was right is wrong
