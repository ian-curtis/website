          <h2>About the Track</h2>
          <p>
            Believe me when I say I struggled with what to name this track. It went through a lot of name changes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                To Lindsey (as in Lindsey Stirling who has been an inspiration since the beginning because of, you know, the old violin plan that didn't go through)
              </li>
              <li>
                When All Seems Lost (this name got transferred to a different track)
              </li>
              <li>
                To A Lost Soul
              </li>
              <li>
                Lost, But Now Found (Apparently I was in a "lost" mood?)
              </li>
              <li>
                Peaceful Rain (not sure where this came from but I have a bunch of files named this)
              </li>
              <li>
                Never Ever Give Up
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            None of these seemed to stick. So I followed the advice of that last name: I never gave up and I kept thinking, landing on my favorite French word, <i>inoubliable</i>, meaning <q>unforgettable</q>.      
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the first track I ever completed. I am very fond of this one (espeically because it uses my favorite chord progression, the trusty Four Chord Power Sequence). Not only that but I managed to pull off a 6/8 time signature AND I came up with the melody all by myself just by messing around on the piano.
