        <h1>About the Album</h1>
        <p>
          I wasn't going to make another album. You wouldn't believe how much work it is to put together an album (and
          my last one was only 10 tracks!). But a series of events led me to do so anyways. Let me list them:
        <ol>
          <li>In Fall 2018, I become (re)addicted to listening to Broadway soundtracks</li>
          <li>Around September, my friend introduces me to the Mean Girls soundtrack</li>
          <li>I decide I really enjoy said soundtrack and listen to it non-stop, admiring the very talented cast: Erika
            Henningsen, Taylor Louderman, Kate Rockwell, Ashley Park, and Kyle Selig to name a few.</li>
          <li>I follow the above on Instagram; Taylor Louderman posts about a Write Out Loud contest, I decide to
            participate</li>
          <li>The song I wrote for the contest (<q>The Light Never Dies</q>) makes me itch to write more music and boom,
            new album ideas.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          I didn't win the contest, nor should I have because the original version of <q>The Light Never Dies</q> was
          not good. The lyrics are close to the same but I really did not sound good in terms of vocals, nor did I have
          the instrumentation settled. But I did get back into writing music.
        </p>
        <p>
          This album was written and recorded before I bought Apple's Logic software and my knowledge of how to create
          music was limited. As a result, the tracks are not mastered, many of the instruments are not <q>locked in</q>
          everywhere, and my vocals need some work. Sure, the lyrics aren't that great and many of them don't rhyme. I
          re-sing each chorus instead of copying over the first one. It sounds like I recorded them in my bedroom (which
          I did!).
        </p>
        <p>
          This album is, however, another step in my learning process. I overcame a huge mental hurdle by publishing my
          vocals online (something I never thought I'd be able to do) and I got experience in working with writing
          lyrics and accompanying vocals.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't want to write any songs about love and relationships because so many songs out there are about those
          things. However, as I was writing and struggling to come up with ideas, I realized that love is kind of
          everywhere, but not always in ways that we expect. As such, I decided to pick out things I loved for reasons
          other than romanticism. Once I found a goal for the album, the specific subjects for the tracks and the album
          name came quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Subliminal Affection</i> is devoted to passions and emotions. It serves to honor the things and people in
          life that we love in a non-romantic sense as sometimes love appears without romance.
        </p>

          The image for the album art was taken by me on a vacation to the Grand Canyon. The sunsets over the canyon are
          stunning.
