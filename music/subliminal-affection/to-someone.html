      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        The chorus came to me quite suddenly and I quickly formed the rest of the lyrics. I nearly scratched this one because it seems too cheesy and too idealistic. It also isn't even about anyone (hence the generic title). I ended up keeping it because of the <q>sublminal affection</q> theme. It is possible to have affection towards people you haven't even met. Every time you hold the door for someone, recycle, or vote, you are showing your sublminal affection. You are not alone in this world and every action has its consequences. Clearly, this song isn't as profound as the ultimate goal behind it but I hope we can keep caring for others.

        (I also wanted to keep it because it has a cool time signature change when the chorus hits. Which I did on accident.)
