      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        Although I'm not too happy with the quality of this song, I am glad I chose to keep it. Music has had a profound effect on me and my life. A lot of what I do is related to music in some way. This is my tribute and thank you to music and what it has done for me and for everyone.

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          There's so much more to you<br>
          Than I will ever know<br>
          What you inspire in me<br>
          Is what makes this so
        </p>
        <p>
          I wonder everyday<br>
          What your influence on me will be<br>
          And I let you take me away<br>
          Far out to sea
        </p>
        <p>
          The calm caressing melodies<br>
          Of your voice send me to sleep<br>
          While the emotion in your cries<br>
          Is enough to make me weep
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaps and bounds of your excitement<br>
          Mean endless energy<br>
          And it's the whisper of your breath<br>
          That brings peace back to me
        </p>
        <p>
          I wish that everyone<br>
          Could understand you as I<br>
          But it's not something one can rush<br>
          Like homework due tonight
        </p>
        <p>
          What I hope is that your power<br>
          Of giving people joy<br>
          Can be spread to as many as possible<br>
          With no price to pay
        </p>
        <p>
          The calm caressing melodies<br>
          Of your voice send me to sleep<br>
          While the emotion in your cries<br>
          Is enough to make me weep
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaps and bounds of your excitement<br>
          Mean endless energy<br>
          And it's the whisper of your breath<br>
          That brings peace back to me
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll always be here when no one else is near<br>
          I rely on your comfort when life turns to dirt
        </p>
        <p>
          The calm caressing melodies<br>
          Of your voice send me to sleep<br>
          While the emotion in your cries<br>
          Is enough to make me weep
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaps and bounds of your excitement<br>
          Mean endless energy<br>
          And it's the whisper of your breath<br>
          That brings peace back to me
