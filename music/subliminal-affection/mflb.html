      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        This song was inspired by my graduation from high school and the anticipation and uncertainty that came with heading to college. After having been in the same building with the same people for four years, suddenly changing everything built up some anxiety. I had no idea what to expect, where to go, or what life would be like (especially since I would be living away from home for the first time).
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't want to write a song about graduating but drew from that experience. The future is unknown to everyone, even to the most powerful rulers. Everyone (I think) has moments where uncertainty about the future causes some adverse feelings. This song is about continuing forward into the future with confidence, knowing that there are others making the same journey.

        This is your call to keep marching forward. Don't forget to look back every once in a while to look at what you've done and to learn from what you've done, what you haven't done, what went right, and what went wrong. Experience builds stamina. Practice makes improvement.
