          <h2>About the Track</h2>
          <p>
            This song was inspired by my graduation from high school and the anticipation and uncertainty that came with heading to college. After having been in the same building with the same people for four years, suddenly changing everything built up some anxiety. I had no idea what to expect, where to go, or what life would be like (especially since I would be living away from home for the first time).
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't want to write a song about graduating but drew from that experience. The future is unknown to everyone, even to the most powerful rulers. Everyone (I think) has moments where uncertainty about the future causes some adverse feelings. This song is about continuing forward into the future with confidence, knowing that there are others making the same journey.
          </p>

            This is your call to keep marching forward. Don't forget to look back every once in a while to look at what you've done and to learn from what you've done, what you haven't done, what went right, and what went wrong. Practice makes improvement. Experience builds stamina.

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          It's there right in front of you:<br>
          The end of an age<br>
          Times of comfort are<br>
          Quickly fading away
        </p>
        <p>
          They say try something new<br>
          And although it seems hard<br>
          Put forth all of your effort<br>
          Make it worth your time
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          March forward, look back<br>
          Don't forget from whence you came<br>
          Be strong in your journeys<br>
          And learn from what you've done
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          It's the challenge of movin' on<br>
          From something you've known for so long<br>
          Caught in an emotional whirlwind<br>
          Of excitement and fear
        </p>
        <p>
          Take some time to think it out<br>
          And make a plan<br>
          'Cause you are strong enough
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't get caught in the uncertainty<br>
          Of what this new life may hold<br>
          Be confident in yourself<br>
          Because you can reach the end
        </p>
        <p>
          Trust those around you<br>
          They can help you on your way<br>
          The love and support of others<br>
          Can help any pain go away
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          March forward, look back<br>
          Don't forget from whence you came<br>
          Be strong in your journeys<br>
          And learn from what you've done
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          It's the challenge of movin' on<br>
          From something you've known for so long<br>
          Caught in an emotional whirlwind<br>
          Of excitement and fear
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll go through many hurdles<br>
          And it won't be easy<br>
          But I have faith in you<br>
          So don't lose faith in yourself
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
          March forward, look back<br>
          Don't forget from whence you came<br>
          Be strong in your journeys<br>
          And learn from what you've done

          You are strong enough
