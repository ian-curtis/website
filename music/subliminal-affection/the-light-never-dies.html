      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        The original version of this track was the inspiration for the album as a whole. Some members of my family (and a ton of people in the world) struggle with anxiety/depression and I think it's super important to remember that there is light in the world. Your struggles might never go away completely or at all so find your light. Find those who can support you and always remember that the light never dies.

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          Lights off, I can't see straight anymore<br>
          Tears fall, there's a puddle on the floor<br>
          Outside, smiles all around<br>
          Not me, eyes on the ground
        </p>
        <p>
          When troubled times come and life stands still<br>
          Remember the sun still shines<br>
          We all have our moments and its totally fine<br>
          But know in your heart that the light never dies
        </p>
        <p>
          Darkness can appear to have no end<br>
          Hope in the future can help that feeling mend<br>
          Don't live in a world that you hate<br>
          Create a place that loves you for who you are
        </p>
        <p>
          When troubled times come and life stands still<br>
          Remember the sun still shines<br>
          We all have our moments and its totally fine<br>
          But know in your heart that the light never dies
        </p>
        <p>
          When troubled times come and life stands still<br>
          Remember the sun still shines<br>
          We all have our moments and its totally fine<br>
          But know in your heart that the light never dies
        </p>
        <p>
          Head up, tears dry<br>
          I am well now because I found myself
