      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        Sadie is not a person, but a dog. She is a very faithful companion; I can't even explain everything that makes her a great dog. She is always there to greet me each morning and when I come home. She lays with me when I do work from home. We have a connection that is hard to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadie is a goldendoodle (this is where the <q>blonde hair</q> comes from). Please enjoy my favorite pictures of her.

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          I haven't known you for very long<br>
          But you've made a huge impact on my life<br>
          Our time together has been worth it<br>
          And I dread the day it ends
        </p>
        <p>
          Your excitement when I see you<br>
          Is always enough to make me smile<br>
          The support you provide when I'm not feeling myself<br>
          Raises my spirits in no time
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadie Rose<br>
          Your soft hair comforts me<br>
          The way it shines in the sun<br>
          Brings out your beauty
        </p>
        <p>
          Blond hair, brown eyes<br>
          Your whole complexion is perfect to me<br>
          You love everyone and<br>
          Everyone loves you
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing dangerous dares come close<br>
          While I'm with you<br>
          You protect me from any harm<br>
          That may come our way
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll miss you incredibly<br>
          When I can't see you every day<br>
          And I know you'll feel the same<br>
          But we'll keep loving each other anyway
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadie Rose<br>
          Your soft hair comforts me<br>
          The way it shines in the sun<br>
          Brings out your beauty
        </p>
        <p>
          Blond hair, brown eyes<br>
          Your whole complexion is perfect to me<br>
          You love everyone and<br>
          Everyone loves you
