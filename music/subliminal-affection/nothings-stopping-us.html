      <h2>About the Track</h2>
      <p>
        There's a lot of bad things in this world and only you can start changing them for the better. Sure, your individual contribution might not be much, but one person taking actions inspires others and soon enough a whole colony of people are doing the right thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing's stopping us, what's stopping you?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Money might be a stopping point, I do admit. However, simply raising awareness for these issues certainly counts as taking action.)

        <h2>Lyrics</h2>
        <p>
          The world appears to be falling apart<br>
          And we are right in the middle<br>
          What are we waiting for<br>
          It's time to take action
        </p>
        <p>
          Problems have been accumulating<br>
          For decades now<br>
          We've got quite the situation
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we change the world<br>
          When no one seems to listen<br>
          Everyone is fighting each other<br>
          In so many different ways
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, all it takes<br>
          If for us to stand together<br>
          We can't keep relying on<br>
          Someone else to do things for us
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not about being on top<br>
          Or having the most success<br>
          We should focus on resolving arguments<br>
          And coming to agreements
        </p>
        <p>
          Expose yourself to other points of view<br>
          Remember that it's not all about you<br>
          Don't give up whatever you do<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          How can we change the world<br>
          When no one seems to listen<br>
          Everyone's fighting each other<br>
          In so many different ways
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, all it takes<br>
          If for us to stop and listen<br>
          And hear the cries<br>
          Of those who need our help
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing's stopping us,<br>
          Nothing's stopping us,<br>
          Nothing's stopping us,<br>
          Nothing's stopping us
        </p>
