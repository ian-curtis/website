      <h1>Accessibility Note</h1>
     <p>
      My goal for this website is that it is able to be read, accessed, and navigated by all users, regardless of device and sight ability. For this reason, I have paid careful attention when designing the site to how other users might see the pages. As of August 2022, the following features are in place:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Links are placed inline with explanatory text
        </li>
        <li>
          Images have alt text
        </li>
        <li>
          Abbreviations have titles
        </li>
        <li>
          Proper headings are used
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain fancier pieces of the site are responsive (i.e., they look good on mobile)
        </li>
        <li>
          Most areas can be navigated by a screen reader
        </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      That being said, I still have much work to do in this regard. The following items are on my list of improvements to make:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Make all areas of the site (notably the navigation bar and panel grids on the <abbr title="curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> page) look good on mobile devices and accessible to screen readers
        </li>
        <li>
          Check color contrasts on all pages
        </li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      I am very open to feedback when it comes to accessibility and am always looking for ways to do better in this regard. Should you come across any problems with the website, whether it be on a certain brower or device or with accessibility, please contact me at [email]. Note that only accessibility-releated emails to this inbox will be answered; all others will be ignored.
