title: Sigma (Intro)
---

*Sigma* is one of the tracks that are math-inspired. Sigma (âˆ‘) is the Greek letter mostly commonly used to represent sums and adding things. I don't really have a reason for choosing it over the other many letters used to represent other various math functions but maybe it's because I can never write them correctly. They always turn out wonky.

This track totally could've been a longer one but I tried for over a year to continue it past its current length and every time I had nothing. So I called it quits and slapped it on as an intro. Yay!
