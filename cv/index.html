Beyond college, I also have a Python Developer Certificate from Zero to Mastery Academy (2021) and a high school diploma from Grandville High School (2019). I now am studying Data Science & Analytics and plan to graduate with a Master's degree in 2025.

            I currently work full time at ALDI, U.S., where I have been since 2019. I also work part time for the <abbr title="Grand Valley State University">GVSU</abbr> Libraries' Open Educational Resources (<abbr title="Open Educational Resources">OER</abbr>) department (since 2021) as an editorial assistant promoting <abbr title="Open Educational Resources">OER</abbr> and converting existing textbooks to accessible online editions (using PreTeXt and Pressbooks).

          <h1>Publications and Projects</h1>
          <p>
            <p>
              I have published several pieces on the French <span class="italics-title">Encyclopédie</span>: An <a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/lib_scholars/2">annotated bibliography</a>, a <a href="https://www.diderotsencyclopedie.com">website housing select scholary sources</a>, an<a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/sss/227"> essay on plagiarism of the plates</a>, and a collaboration with Drs.
