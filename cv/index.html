Beyond college, I also have a Python Developer Certificate from Zero to Mastery Academy (2021) and a high school diploma from Grandville High School (2019). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Following my undergraduate programs, I plan to continue my education with a Master's degree in Data Science & Analytics.

        <div class="cv-box">
          <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
          <p>
            I currently work part time at ALDI, U.S., where I have been since July 2019.

            In the past I have had positions at CoreLife Eatery: Team Member from 2017-2018 and Lead Grill Cook from 2018-2019. Earlier than that, I was an umpire for local Little League baseball games.

          <p>
            When it comes to programming languages, I have the most experience with Python, R, and PreTeXt but also know a decent amount of HTML, CSS, and LaTeX. With these latter three and a handful of other langauges / databases, I try to learn as I go.
